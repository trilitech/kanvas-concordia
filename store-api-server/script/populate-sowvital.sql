  ('Survival', 'The Survival videos reflect microscopic iterations of the big bang. Each video brings you on a journey from AI-conception to realisation as the image of the flower strives to survive amidst the sea of digital imagery. This series reflects on the role of AI within artistic creation and the increasing cognitive abilities of the machines we have built. As Marco explains, his relationship with this AI programme is comparable to that with his living plants. He tends to them, monitors their evolution, and is in continuous awe of their changing beauty.'),
  ('Interpolation', 'Marco’s machine learning algorithm interpolated AI creativity into botanical art. Injecting digital colour, fluorescence, and the uncanny into the evolution of flora, the Interpolation Series pushes nature and artistic medium to its limits. Marco’s programming instigated a whole process of creation that, once it was set off, was out of his hands. Through the machine’s process of de-identification, in which unknown images are rendered from those familiar to us, Marco prompted the creation of something new.'),
  ('AI Herbarium', 'Metavert’s AI Herbarium consists of a collection of 50 still images extracted from the AI-generated flowering videos. Marco’s AI Herbarium attached a botanical Latin name to each newly discovered specimen. Botanical historian and curator of Metavert, Kimberly Glassman, devised the Latin names in the series by first using the AI plant identification app, PictureThis to identify the image’s closest genus and then attributed an additional characteristic in Latin, following the Linnean binomial naming system. Each image represents a new, unique species of flora that exists solely in the realm of the digital.');
